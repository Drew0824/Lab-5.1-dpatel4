# Calculating Time

Computers normally treat time as the number of seconds from an arbitrary starting point called an epoch. Write a C++ program that asks the user for the current hour of the day (from 0 to 23), the current minute of the hour (from 0 to 59) and the current second of the minute (from 0 to 59). 

Use the userâ€™s input to calculate the number of seconds since midnight that their time represents.

Sample input and output is shown below.

`Enter the hour of the day:` **3**
`Enter the minutes of the hour:` **45**
`Enter the seconds passed in the current minute:` **3**
`The time in seconds since midnight is: 13503`
